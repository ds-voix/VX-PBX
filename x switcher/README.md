This branch is now abandoned, since refactoring was done. This proof-of-concept was rewritten by regular code.

Please, use [X switcher v1.0 pre-release](https://github.com/ds-voix/xswitcher) . It is now stable enough and fully customizable (all functionality except of "Exec" action).
The precompiled static binary is also placed under "bin/" directory.
